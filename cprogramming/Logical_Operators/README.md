#Logical Operators

##Operators:
 Specific, simple functions that act on primitive data types, like integers and strings.
 Typically, operators work on the most primitive types in programming languages: mathematical operators work on integers and floats, while logical operators work on booleans

##Mathematical Operators:
 Operators that perform mathematical functions, like adding numbers together or assigning values to variables.

##Logical Operators:
 Operators that perform logical operations, such as comparing relative values, checking equality, checking set membership, or evaluating combinations of other logical operators.

##Relational Operators:
  Operators that check the relationships between multiple variables, such as checking if they are equal or if one is greater than another.

##Numeric Comparison Operators:
 Operators that facilitate numeric comparison between values. Typically, these are 'greater than' (>), 'greater than or equal to' (>=), 'equal to' (==), 'less than' (<), and 'less than or equal to' (<=).
 These operators can sometimes be used for comparisons that are not numeric, but that nonetheless have an underlying order:
 1. A string of characters is 'less' than another string if it comes earlier alphabetically. "Apple" would be 'less' than "Banana".
 2. A date is 'less' than another date if it comes earlier in time. January 1st, 2017 would be 'less' than January 15th, 2017.

##Non-Numeric Equality Comparisons:
 Nearly any kind of data can compare for equality, even if it isn't numeric. We can't ask if an apple is greater than an orange, but we can ask if apples and oranges are 'equal', or the same thing.

##Set Operators:
 Check to see if a value is a member of a set of multiple values. Most often this comes up in strings and lists.
